###  🎮 Vanilla FCL Features

> ~~I agree with what you said, but「FCL」is a Minecraft Java Edition launcher made by FCL-Team, built upon the core functionalities of [HMCL](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL) and integrating the [PojavLauncher](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher) backends. The launcher is used in a system called「Android」, where the person selected by the system will be authorized to use 「JVM」, operating the power of 「Java」. You are going to act a mysterious user called「Greenhand」. During the freely use of the launcher, you can install different versions, make various mods work together and find out the reason of crash, discover the truth of「xxException:」.~~
